# Demand forecasting for shared bikes
> In this project we want to understand the demand for a bike sharing platform. On the basis of historical dataset we want to find the factors that affect demand and will help us predict it. We can further use this knowledge to prepare and plan for the future demand and maximize the profit.

## General Information
- BoomBikes is a US based bike sharing platform that allows customers to borrow bikes from the dock for a price by entering their payment information. The bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to company.
- The company has suffered in revenue in the corona pandemic and has decided to prepare a mindful business plan for future to make huge profits.
- Dataset is given to demonstrate the bike demand across the American market. It has various attributes like meteorological surveys and people preferences.
- With data from 2018 to 2019 the company want to identify which parameters in dataset are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. We will carry this investigation by using appropriate EDA and machine learning algorithm (that is Multiple Linear regression model). 

## Conclusions
- Rainy weather will affect the demand negatively. We will have most of the bikes not utilized during this time hence we can get them serviced.
- Demand will be very less during spring season or in the month of January, Febrauary and March, hence it will benefit the company to advertize a lot during this time.
- Days with no windspeed and considerable temperatures will have good demand.
- September month will see good demand. Hence we can expect good number of users.
